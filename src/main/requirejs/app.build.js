    //then it assumed your scripts are in a subdirectory under this path.
    //This option is not required. If it is not specified, then baseUrl
    //below is the anchor point for finding things. If this option is specified,

    //output area, and baseUrl will assume to be a relative path under
    //this directory.

    //line or by properties in the a config file, and configuration that was
    //passed to requirejs as part of the app's runtime "main" JS file is *not*
    //considered. However, if you prefer for the that "main" JS file configuration
    //to be read for the build so that you do not have to duplicate the values
    //in a separate configuration, set this property to the location of that
    //main JS file. The first requirejs({}), require({}), requirejs.config({}),

    //Right now only the following values
    //are supported:
    //- "uglify": (default) uses UglifyJS to minify the code.
    //- "closure": uses Google's Closure Compiler in simple optimization
    //mode to minify the code. Only available if running the optimizer using
    //Java.
    //- "closure.keepLines": Same as closure option, but keeps line returns
    //in the minified files.
    //- "none": no minification will be done.
    optimize: "uglify",
    
    //Allow CSS optimizations. Allowed values:
    //- "standard": @import inlining, comment removal and line returns.
    //Removing line returns may have problems in IE, depending on the type
    //of CSS.
    //- "standard.keepLines": like "standard" but keeps line returns.
    //- "none": skip CSS optimizations.
    //- "standard.keepComments": keeps the file comments, but removes line
    //returns. (r.js 1.0.8+)
    //- "standard.keepComments.keepLines": keeps the file comments and line
    //returns. (r.js 1.0.8+)
